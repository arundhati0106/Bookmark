# BookMark
- A React Js project that showcases CRUD operations on abook-app, where users are free to  to choose and customize their favourite books, and retrive them as well, using a pre-existing free API. (READ)

- Can add, remove books from Favourites using useState() (Partial DELETE)

- User can update the details of a book namely, description, author and genre... but since the API was only enabling GET request, I used Redux, and mock data to enable temporary (UPDATE) feature.

- User can delete books from the list of books available (DELETE)

- User can add new books using a modal to enter details of the said book.  (CREATE)
